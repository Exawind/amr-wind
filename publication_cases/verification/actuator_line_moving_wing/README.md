Note that for the moving_wing ALM verification case, 2 modifications needed to be applied directly in the AMR-Wind code to allow it to use a 2D actuator applied in a 3D domain (3D domain was necessary for permitting static refinement): setting the local distance in y to zero for all actuator points within the ActSrcOp operator in amr-wind/wind_energy/actuator/ActSrcLineOp.H and expanding the bounding box to cover the extent of the domain in the y direction for the linear motion case in amr-wind/wind_energy/actuator/wind/fixed_wind_ops.H. These simulations can be replicated using AMR-Wind after the PR # was merged, corresponding to commit <hash>.

This case looks at convergence with decreasing dx, so for different simulations the dx was modified by changing the max number of levels. The CFL was maintained constant for the different cases, requiring a change in dt with a change of dx, which was also accompanied by changing the output frequency of the actuator post_processing.
