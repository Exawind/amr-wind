`Kynema-SGF <https://github.com/kynema/kynema-sgf>`_ (formerly AMR-Wind), wherein SGF stands for structured-grid fluid dynamics, is a 
massively parallel, block-structured adaptive-mesh, incompressible
flow solver. The codebase was initiated in 2019 from `incflo
<https://github.com/AMReX-Codes/incflo>`_. The solver is built on top of the
`AMReX library <https://amrex-codes.github.io/amrex>`_. AMReX library provides
the mesh data structures, mesh adaptivity, as well as the linear solvers used
for solving the governing equations. Kynema-SGF is actively developed and
maintained by a dedicated multi-institutional team from `Lawrence Berkeley
National Laboratory <https://www.lbl.gov/>`_, `National Laboratory
of the Rockies <https://nlr.gov>`_, and `Sandia National Laboratories
<https://sandia.gov>`_.

The primary applications for Kynema-SGF are: performing large-eddy simulations
(LES) of atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) flows, simulating wind farm
turbine-wake interactions using actuator disk or actuator line models for
turbines, and as a background solver when coupled with a near-body solver (e.g.,
`Kynema-UGF <https://github.com/kynema/kynema-ugf>`_) with overset methodology to
perform blade-resolved simulations of multiple wind turbines within a wind farm.
For offshore applications, the ability to model the air-sea interaction effects
and its impact on the ABL characteristics is another focus for the code
development effort. As with other codes in the
`Kynema <https://github.com/kynema>`_ ecosystem, Kynema-SGF shares the following
objectives:

- an open, well-documented implementation of the state-of-the-art
  computational models for modeling wind farm flow physics at various
  fidelities that are backed by a comprehensive verification and
  validation (V&V) process (:ref:`capabilities`);

- be capable of performing the highest-fidelity simulations of flow fields within
  wind farms; and

- be able to leverage the high-performance leadership class computing
  facilities available at DOE national laboratories.
