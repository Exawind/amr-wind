# Preprocessing and postprocessing tools

This directory contains a collection of helpful preprocessing and
postprocessing utilities. Please consult the documentation more information,
including a brief summary of each one. The source code for tools written in C++ is
in the utilities directory. These are compiled with AMR-Wind, and their executables
are written to folders in the same build directory.
