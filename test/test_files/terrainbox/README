This is a simple test case to verify the terrain setup. A box is created and a freestream velocity
is specified. Diffusion is turned off. The flow field is sampled inside the terrain region. The sampled
velocity should be a very small value (this method drives the cell center value towards zero).

The createTerrain.py file can be used to change the size of the box and resolution. computeError.py file
returns the mean value inside the box.
