This is the sample terrain case. You need to run "python3.XX backendinterface.py NREL.yaml" in the tools/terrain folder.
The output of the python execution will be a file "terrain.amrwind". This file needs to be copied to this folder before 
execution to avoid an error message. 

The python tool backendinterface.py generates both precursor and terrain case folders. Modify the NREL.yaml file to cater
to your needs and generate the cases. The terrain cases are designed to run with the Kosovic turbulence model.
