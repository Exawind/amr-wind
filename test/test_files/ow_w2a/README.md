The files "input_HOS.dat" and "3d.dat" are not used by AMR-Wind to run this simulation. "input_HOS.dat" is the input file used to run HOS-Ocean, which produces the "modes_HOS_SWENSE.dat" file. This modes file is used by AMR-Wind and its submodule, Waves2AMR, to run the simulation. "3d.dat" is also output by HOS-Ocean, which lists the dimensional parameters of the HOS-Ocean simulation, and these two unused files are included here for reference.
