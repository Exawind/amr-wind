===============

This section outline how to get started with AMR-Wind, providing detailed compilation instructions on how to use Exawind-Manager,
a Spack-based package management tool customized for the ExaWind software suite,
of which AMR-Wind is an integral part. The turbulent flow conditions are established
through precursor simulations, and then turbines are placed in the flow.
