Turbulence Models
-----------------

RANS models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The RANS models are available in two flavors: wall-modeled and wall-resolved. The former model is 
designed for cases with :math:`y+ > 30` while the latter requires :math:`y+ < 5`. The wall-modeled RANS 
model available in AMR-Wind is based on the work of `Axell and Liungman (EFM 2001 ) <https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1011560202388>`_.
The code also includes Menter's K-Omega SST model with IDDES support. 

Axell One-Equation RANS Model 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The one-equation model solves the transport equation for turbulent kinetic energy (TKE). The length scale is computed using algebraic equations. 
The transport equation for TKE is given by: 

.. math:: \frac{ \partial (\rho k)}{\partial t} 
   + \nabla \cdot (\rho U k)  =  P_s + P_b - \epsilon + D 

Here :math:`P_s` is the shear production term, :math:`P_b` is the buoyancy production/destruction term, :math:`\epsilon` is the turbulent dissipation 
rate and :math:`D` is the turbulent diffusion term. These terms are computed as follows 

.. math:: P_s= \nu_t S^2

.. math:: P_b= -{\nu_t}^{'} N^2 

.. math:: \epsilon= C_0 \frac{k^3/2}{L}

.. math:: D = \frac{\partial}{\partial x_j} [(\nu+\nu_t)\frac{\partial U_j}{\partial x_i}]

Here :math:`P_s` is the strain rate, :math:`P_b` is the buoyancy frequency and :math:`L` is the length scale computed algebraically.
The strain rate and buoyancy frequency are computed using the same method used in the literature and are not repeated here. The 
length scale is computed as follows: 

.. math:: \frac{1}{L^2} = \frac{1}{Ls^2} + \frac{1}{Lb^2}

The shear length scale is given by :math:`Ls=\kappa z`. An upper limit can be imposed for the shear length scale to avoid excessive values. 
In the current model, it is set to 30 and can be modified to be computed from Geostrophic wind too. The buoyancy length scale is given by 

.. math:: Lb = Cb \frac{\sqrt{k}}{N} 

The implementation methodology is different for stable/neutral and unstable stratification and follows the recommendation in the paper. The
turbulent viscosity is computed as follows: 

..  math:: \nu_t = C_\mu \sqrt{k} L 

..  math:: {\nu_t}^{'} = {C_\mu}^{'} \sqrt{k} L 

Here :math:`C_\mu` and :math:`{C_\mu}^{'}` are non-uniform model constants which depend on :math:`C_0` and turbulent Richardson number 
:math:`Rt`. The calculations of these terms can be found in the reference. The turbulent Prandtl number also depends on the turbulent 
Richardson number and is computed using am empirical expression from the reference. The boundary condition for TKE at the lower boundary 
is given by: 

.. math:: k = k_w ^ {(2/3)}

.. math:: k_w = \frac{{u_*}^{3}}{{C_0}^3} + \frac{\max{(Q,0)}\kappa d_1}{{C_0}^3}

Here :math:`Q` is the sensible heat flux at the surface and :math:`d_1`  is the near-wall distance. For cases with terrain, there is also 
a check for near-wall distance from the surface of the terrain. The wall boundary condition is implemented as a forcing term at the first cell 
above the lower surface and terrain. 


LES models for subgrid scales
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Smagorinsky model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Simple eddy viscosity model, the dissipation is calculated using the
resolved strain rate tensor and the grid resolution as

.. math::

   \begin{aligned}
       \tau_{ij} &= -2 \nu_t \widetilde{S}_{ij} \\
       \nu_t &= C_s^2 \Delta^2 (2 \langle S_{ij} S_{ij} \rangle)^{\frac{1}{2}}
   \end{aligned}


AMDNoTherm model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This is the implementation of the base AMD model, useful for flows without a temperature field.

The eddy viscosity is calculated using an anisotropic derivative with a
different filter width in each direction

.. math::

   \begin{aligned}
       \hat{\partial}_i &= \sqrt{C} \delta_i \partial_i \textrm{ for } i=1,2,3 \\
       C &= 1/3, \textrm{ Poincare coefficient for } 2^{nd} \textrm{ order gradient} \\
       \delta_i &= \textrm{Filter width along dimension } i \textrm{ for anisotropic grids}
   \end{aligned}

The anisotropic derivative is used to define the eddy viscosity as

.. math::

   \begin{aligned}
       \tau_{ij} &= -2 \nu_t \widetilde{S}_{ij} \\
       \nu_t &= \frac{- (\hat{\partial}_k \widetilde{u}_i) (\hat{\partial}_k \widetilde{u}_j) \widetilde{S}_{ij}}{ (\partial_l \widetilde{u}_m) (\partial_l \widetilde{u}_m) }
   \end{aligned}


AMD model (for ABL)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The eddy viscosity is calculated using an anisotropic derivative with a
different filter width in each direction

.. math::

   \begin{aligned}
       \hat{\partial}_i &= \sqrt{C} \delta_i \partial_i \textrm{ for } i=1,2,3 \\
       C &= 1/3 \textrm{ Poincare coefficient for } 2^{nd} \textrm{ order gradient} \\
       \delta_i &= \textrm{Filter width along dimension } i \textrm{ for anisotropic grids}\\
       \beta &= g/\Theta_0 \textrm{ Gravity constant over reference temperature}
   \end{aligned}

The anisotropic derivative is used to define the eddy viscosity as

.. math::

   \begin{aligned}
       \tau_{ij} &= -2 \nu_t \widetilde{S}_{ij} \\
       \nu_t &= \frac{- (\hat{\partial}_k \widetilde{u}_i) (\hat{\partial}_k \widetilde{u}_j) \widetilde{S}_{ij} +  \beta (\hat{\partial}_k \widetilde{w}) (\hat{\partial}_k (\widetilde{\Theta} - \langle {\widetilde{\Theta}} \rangle) )  }{ (\partial_l \widetilde{u}_m) (\partial_l \widetilde{u}_m) } \\
       \tau_{\theta j} &= -2 D_e \frac{\partial \widetilde{\Theta}}{\partial x_j} \\
       D_e &= \frac{- (\hat{\partial}_k \widetilde{u}_i) (\hat{\partial}_k \widetilde{\Theta}) \partial_i \widetilde{\Theta} }{(\partial_l \widetilde{\Theta}) (\partial_l \widetilde{\Theta})}
   \end{aligned}

- **Unit tests**

There is a simple unit test for both :math:`\nu_t` and :math:`D_e` in
``unit_tests/turbulence/test_turbulence_LES.cpp`` under
``test_AMD_setup_calc``.

Non-linear Sub-grid Scale Model 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The non-linear model extends the Smagorinsky model by including an extra term computed from the strain and vorticity rate. 
The modification proposed by `Branco (JFM 1997) <https://doi.org/10.1017/S0022112096004697>`_ and implemented in WRF (`Mirocha et. al (MWR 2010) <https://doi.org/10.1175/2010MWR3286.1>`_) 
is the model considered. The sub-grid scale stress tensor is calculated as follows: 

 .. math::
    M_{ij}= -(C_s \Delta)^2 
    [
      2(2S_{mn}S_{mn})^{1/2}S_{ij}+C_1(S_{ik}S_{kj}-\frac{1}{3}S_{mn}S_{mn} \delta_{ij})
      +C_2(S_{ik}R_{kj}-R_{ik}S_{kj})
    ]

Here :math:`S_{ij}` is the strain-rate tensor and :math:`R_{ij}` is the vorticity rate tensor. The model constants are: 
:math:`C_s=[8*(1+C_b)/27\pi^2]^{1/2}`, :math:`C_1=C_2=960^{1/2}C_b/7(1+C_b)S_k`, :math:`S_k=0.5`, and :math:`C_b=0.36`.  

The default length scale of :math:`L=C_s\Delta` causes over-prediction of the mean wind speed profiles. To avoid this over-prediction, the
length scale is modified as follows 

.. math::
   L=(1-\exp(-z/H))^2(\frac{\kappa z}{\phi_M})^2+(\exp(-z/H))^2(C_s \Delta)^2

Here the term :math:`H=1.5 dz` specifies the location at which the length scale switches to :math:`L=C_s\Delta` and :math:`\phi_M`
is the atmospheric stability function. Currently, the implementation for the stability function uses a single global value. 
The implementation of the non-linear model is split into two parts. The subgrid-scale viscosity term is directly used 
within the AMR-Wind diffusion framework. The last two terms in :math:`M_{ij}` are added as source-terms in the momentum equation.
