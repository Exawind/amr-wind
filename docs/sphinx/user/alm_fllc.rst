Filtered lifting line correction (FLLC)
=======================================

To accurately represent wind turbine using the actuator line model (ALM) with OpenFAST, the user must select ALM parameters that are appropriate for the turbine of interest and for the near-turbine grid resolution.

The standard ALM has uniformly spaced points and thus requires a fine value of epsilon and a large number of points along the blade to properly model it. In recent years, a correction, called filtered lifting line correction (FLLC), has been developed :cite:p:`martinez-tossas_meneveau_2019`. Such a correction also includes the use of points that are not uniformly spaced, thus lifting the requirement of small values of epsilon. It is recommended that you run the ALM with the FLLC on. 

To enable the ALM with OpenFAST coupling, ``Actuator`` should be added to ``incflo.physics``, ``ActuatorForcing`` should be added to ``ICNS.source_terms``, and ``Actuator.type = TurbineFastLine`` should be set. Next, the user should enable FLLC, choose its type, and set the option for a non-uniform point distribution:

.. code-block:: none

    Actuator.TurbineFastLine.fllc = 1
    Actuator.TurbineFastLine.fllc_nonuniform = 1
    Actuator.TurbineFastLine.fllc_type = variable_chord

When selecting the ``Actuator.TurbineFastLine.fllc_nonuniform`` as ``1``, a new distribution of points is calculated internally, based on the ``Actuator.TurbineFastLine.num_points_blade`` and ``Actuator.TurbineFastLine.fllc_eps_dr_ratio`` entries. The ``Actuator.TurbineFastLine.fllc_eps_dr_ratio`` value should be at least 1 with a maximum value of 3. It is recommended to use the value 3. This parameter controls the distribution of points, and its value should be selected based on the desired accuracy of the correction, according to Table 1 given in :cite:`MartinezFLLCimpl`.

.. code-block:: none

    Actuator.TurbineFastLine.fllc_eps_dr_ratio = 3

.. note::

    The entries ``Actuator.TurbineFastLine.num_points_blade`` and ``Actuator.TurbineFastLine.num_points_tower`` should match the entries ``NumBlNds`` from the AeroDyn blade file  and ``NumTwrNds`` from the AeroDyn input file.

Two values of epsilon should be set for the FLLC: the regular epsilon and an epsilon for the chord. The regular ``epsilon`` should be set to twice the grid resolution. If you have a very fine grid near the turbine, e.g. 0.625 m,, then you can set ``epsilon`` to be 3 to 4 times the local grid resolution. The smaller the epsilon value, the more sensitive to the resolution the ALM will be. The ``epsilon_chord`` parameter represents the ideal epsilon value if FLLC were not to be used. However, we set both epsilon parameters for FLLC. One of the key details of the correction is that it uses the ``epsilon_chord`` on the non-uniform points, and this should be set to a target value regardless of the underlying grid resolution. The target values again depend on the desired accuracy of the correction and guidelines are also given on Table 1 of :cite:`MartinezFLLCimpl`.

.. code-block:: none

    Actuator.TurbineFastLine.epsilon       = 10 10 10        # for a near-turbine grid of 5 m
    Actuator.TurbineFastLine.epsilon_chord = 0.25 0.25 0.25  # for any grid resolution

.. tip::

    If your near-turbine grid is not isotropic, then consider your "grid resolution" to be the largest of :math:`\Delta x`,  :math:`\Delta y`, and  :math:`\Delta z`. 

Lastly, in certain cases, a numerical instability can arise from the application of the correction on the first few time steps. When a simulation begins, there is often an initial spike in some of the ALM quantities that affect the correction. Thus, in these scenarios, the user can chose a delay, in seconds, to start the correction. In cases where instabilities are observed, a 5-second delay has been shown to be sufficient:

.. code-block:: none

    Actuator.TurbineFastLine.fllc_start_time = 5
