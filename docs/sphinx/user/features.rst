Capabilities and Roadmap
========================

This section documents a non-exhaustive list of current AMR-Wind
capabilities and roadmap for future capabilities.

.. tip::

   If your project relies on a capability that is not yet present in
   AMR-Wind, please create an issue on the code project page.


.. note::

   This reflects the capabilities for AMR-Wind version 2.1.0 and above.


Capabilities
------------

.. tip::

   The capabilities are linked to the relevant input file references
   (keyword `inp`) and documentation (keyword `doc`). Searching for
   those keywords in the `test/test_files` directory will give
   concrete examples of the feature usage.

Roadmap
-------

The roadmap is an evolving, living document and does not purport to
track every future capability. It is not a promise of future
capabilities. The main use case is to inform users of
potential upcoming new capabilities.

Current development
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Inflow-outflow BCs to enable coupling amr-wind to ERF mesoscale modeling software

* Temporal and spatial varying MMC forcing

* Complex terrain

   * Improved wall conditions, e.g., non-uniform roughness, temperature and heat fluxes

   * Complex terrain though immersed boundary methods
