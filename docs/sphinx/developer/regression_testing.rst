Regression testing
===================

AMR-Wind comes with a suite of regression tests to ensure that the relevant
parts of the code are working correctly, and any code modifications do not
introduce errors. These tests are run nightly using an automated system and the
results are published on a `public dashboard
<https://my.cdash.org/index.php?project=Exawind>`_. We ensure that the testing
covers multiple operating systems (currently Linux and MacOS), different
compilers (GCC, Intel, LLVM Clang, and NVIDIA CUDA), as well as two different
versions of AMReX library -- a stable monthly snapshot, and the
version-of-the-day (VOTD) development branch. In addition to the nightly
testing, `continuous integration (CI) capability <https://github.com/Exawind/amr-wind/actions?query=workflow%3AAMR-Wind-CI>`_ is used to test pull-requests to
ensure that they pass all tests before they are merged to the mainline codebase.

Enabling and running regression tests
-------------------------------------

AMR-Wind uses `CTest <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html>`_
and its integration with `CMake
<https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake.1.html>`_ for the nightly
regression test suite. Developers can enable and use the tests locally on their
machine to assist development of new features and ensuring that the
modifications do not break current capabilities. Regression testing is not
enabled by default in a CMake build and must be enabled explicitly by the user.
To enable regression testing, the user must enable additional flags during the
CMake configure phase: :cmakeval:`AMR_WIND_ENABLE_TESTS` and
:cmakeval:`AMR_WIND_TEST_WITH_FCOMPARE` as shown below:

.. code-block:: console

   # Switch to AMR-wind source code
   cd ${HOME}/exawind/source/amr-wind
   # Create a build directory
   mkdir build-test
   # Run configure with testing flags
   cmake -DAMR_WIND_ENABLE_TESTS=ON -DAMR_WIND_TEST_WITH_FCOMPARE=ON ../
   # Build code
   make -j 4

.. tip::

   The flag ``AMR_WIND_ENABLE_TESTS`` activates CTest facility and enables the
   use of CTest to run the regression test facility. However, this in itself
   does not check whether the tests are producing the correct output. The second
   flag ``AMR_WIND_TEST_WITH_FCOMPARE`` uses AMReX :program:`fcompare` utility
   to test the plotfile outputs against *gold files* to ensure that the results
   haven't changed.

Upon successful build, you will notice that a new executable :program:`fcompare` is
built, and CTest has been enabled.

.. code-block:: console

   # List available tests
   ctest -N

   # Run available tests (using 8 parallel processes)
   # show output if a test fails otherwise suppress output
   ctest -j 8 --output-on-failure

   # Run tests with that match a particular regex
   ctest -R abl_godunov --output-on-failure -j 8

   # Rerun only tests that failed previously
   ctest --rerun-failed --output-on-failure -j 8

.. warning::

   Regression testing capability is only available using the CMake build
   process. The legacy GNUMakefile process does not support the regression
   testing capability via CTest. The user must manually run the cases with
   :program:`amr_wind` and then run :program:`fcompare` to determine issues.

Testing against gold files
--------------------------

To use :program:`fcompare` to determine if the code has been built properly and
generates the correct results, we must provide *gold solutions* for the tests.
Currently, the gold files are not released with the code, so a local copy must
be generated by the user. The recommended process is to download the appropriate
version of AMR-Wind, build and run the executable once to generate the gold
files and copy it into the appropriate directory and use them during the
development process. This is not an ideal setup and will be rectified in future.
We recommend running the unit tests to ensure that the build process worked
correctly to generate the correct executable. The gold files directory is
printed out during the configure phase, as shown below:

.. code-block:: console

   -- AMR-Wind Information:
   -- CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME = Darwin
   -- CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_ID = AppleClang
   -- CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_VERSION = 11.0.0.11000033
   -- CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE = RelWithDebInfo
   -- Test golds directory for fcompare: $HOME/exawind/source/amr-wind/test/AMR-WindGoldFiles/Darwin/AppleClang/11.0.0.11000033
   -- Configuring done
   -- Generating done
   -- Build files have been written to: $HOME/exawind/source/amr-wind/build-test

The default gold files directory is
``test/AMR-WindGoldFiles/${OS}/${COMPILER}/${COMPILER_VERSION}``.

.. code-block:: console

   # Ensure that you are in the build directory
   # Run CTest first time (all tests will fail as there are no golds to compare with)
   ctest -j 8

   # Create initial version of Golds
   cp -R test/test_files/* <absolute_path_to_test_golds>

   # Rerun CTest again and all tests should pass
   ctest -j 8

Example output for a failed test
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following shows an example of a failed test and the typical output generated
by ``fcompare`` that can be used for diagnostics.

.. code-block:: console

  0% tests passed, 1 tests failed out of 1

  Label Time Summary:

  Total Test time (real) =   9.76 sec

  The following tests FAILED:
  	  7 - abl_godunov (Failed)
  Errors while running CTest

During testing, :program:`fcompare` will calculate the differences for each
field in the plot file against gold files. Currently any difference is flagged
as an error and causes the test to fail as seen from the above example. The test
can also fail if the grids don't match (e.g., due to different regrid based on
refinement criteria) or if certain fields are missing in the plot file.

Test file organization
----------------------

The regression tests are organized in the directory
:file:`amr-wind/tests/test_files` and are arranged in directories corresponding
to the name of the test. Each directory contains the input file
:file:`<test-name.i>` and any other files necessary to run the test case. The
test definitions are added to :file:`amr-wind/tests/CTestList.cmake`.

Creating new regression tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

New tests can be added using the following steps:

- Create a new directory with the desired test name within the tests directory.

- Add appropriate input files necessary to run the tests

- Add a new entry into :file:`CTestList.cmake`

- Rerun CMake configure to allow CMake to detect the new tests

- Build, test, refine the feature

- Commit the new test directory along with relevant source code updates to Git

For example, to create a new test called ``abl_godnov`` (ABL simulation using
Godunov numerical scheme). The entry in the test file is shown below

.. code-block:: console

   add_test_re(abl_godunov 4)

The second argument to ``add_test_re`` indicates the number of parallel
processes used to run the test. Currently it is recommended that the tests be
run using 4 MPI ranks.

Test outputs and troubleshooting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

During development, it is likely that some tests fail and it is necessary to
examine the outputs and plot files for troubleshooting. CTest stores all outputs
in the same directory structure as the test file but within the build directory.
For example, if the build directory is :file:`build-test` then the outputs for
the test `abl_godunov` will be stored in the directory
:file:`build-test/test/test_files/abl_godunov/`. At least two outputs are always
generated: a log file (e.g., :file:`abl_godunov.log`) that contains the output
usually printed to the console during :program:`amr_wind` execution, and plot
file output.
