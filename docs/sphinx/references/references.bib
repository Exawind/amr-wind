	Abstract = {We present the piecewise parabolic method, a higher-order extension of Godunov's method. There are several new features of this method which distinguish it from other higher-order Godunov-type methods. We use a higher-order spatial interpolation than previously used, which allows for a steeper representation of discontinuities, particularly contact discontinuities. We introduce a simpler and more robust algorithm for calculating the nonlinear wave interactions used to compute fluxes. Finally, we recognize the need for additional dissipation in any higher-order Godunov method of this type, and introduce it in such a way so as not to degrade the quality of the results.},

abstract = {We present a class of second-order conservative finite difference algorithms for solving numerically time-dependent problems for hyperbolic conservation laws in several space variables. These methods are upwind and multidimensional, in that the numerical fluxes are obtained by solving the characteristic form of the full multidimensional equations at the zone edge, and that all fluxes are evaluated and differenced at the same time; in particular, operator splitting is not used. Correct behavior at discontinuities is obtained by the use of solutions to the Riemann problem, and by limiting some of the second-order terms. Numerical results are presented, which show that the methods described here yield the same high resolution as the corresponding operator split methods.}

abstract = {An unsplit upwind method for solving hyperbolic conservation laws in three dimensions is developed. This paper derives the algorithm by generalizing a two-dimensional advection algorithm of Van Leer and Colella to three dimensions and then making appropriate modifications. The method is implemented using the equations of gas dynamics. Several test problems are computed to both verify and display the behavior of the method. These test problems include a 1D blast wave, a 2D shock reflection off a 30° ramp, and a 3D astrophysical jet.}

@article{Vanleer:1977,
	Abstract = {An approach to numerical convection is presented that exclusively yields upstream-centered schemes. It starts from a meshwise approximation of the initial-value distribution by simple basic functions, e.g., Legendre polynomials. In every mesh the integral of the distribution is conserved. The overall approximation need not be continuous. The approximate distribution is convected explicitly and then remapped meshwise in terms of the basic functions. The weights of the basic functions that approximate the initial values in a mesh may be determined by finite differencing, but the most accurate schemes are obtained by least-squares fitting. In the latter schemes, the weights of the basic functions must be regarded as independent state quantities and must be stored separately. Examples of second-order and third-order schemes are given, and the accuracy of these schemes is discussed. Several monotonicity algorithms, designed to prevent numerical oscillations, are indicated. Numerical examples are given of linear and nonlinear wave propagation, also regarding monotonicity.},

@article{Pedersen:2014,
	Abstract = {A range of large-eddy simulations, with differing free atmosphere stratification and zero or slightly positive surface heat flux, is investigated to improve understanding of the neutral and near-neutral, inversion-capped, horizontally homogeneous, barotropic atmospheric boundary layer with emphasis on the upper region. We find that an adjustment time of at least 16 h is needed for the simulated flow to reach a quasi-steady state. The boundary layer continues to grow, but at a slow rate that changes little after 8 h of simulation time. A common feature of the neutral simulations is the development of a super-geostrophic jet near the top of the boundary layer. The analytical wind-shear models included do not account for such a jet, and the best agreement with simulated wind shear is seen in cases with weak stratification above the boundary layer. Increasing the surface heat flux decreases the magnitude and vertical extent of the jet and leads to better agreement between analytical and simulated wind-speed profiles. Over a range of different inversion strengths and surface heat fluxes, we also find good agreement between the performed simulations and models of the equilibrium boundary-layer height, and of the budget of turbulent kinetic energy integrated across the boundary layer.},

abstract = {Abstract This article presents a wind plant control strategy that optimizes the yaw settings of wind turbines for improved energy production of the whole wind plant by taking into account wake effects. The optimization controller is based on a novel internal parametric model for wake effects called the FLOw Redirection and Induction in Steady-state (FLORIS) model. The FLORIS model predicts the steady-state wake locations and the effective flow velocities at each turbine, and the resulting turbine electrical energy production levels, as a function of the axial induction and the yaw angle of the different rotors. The FLORIS model has a limited number of parameters that are estimated based on turbine electrical power production data. In high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics simulations of a small wind plant, we demonstrate that the optimization control based on the FLORIS model increases the energy production of the wind plant, with a reduction of loads on the turbines as an additional effect.

Such control strategies are often different from those that are optimal for an individual turbine. One type of wind-plant control method is to redirect the wakes of upstream turbines so that they avoid downstream turbines. In this paper, we investigate several possible methods for redirecting turbine wakes, including some existing and some novel approaches. The methods are compared in terms of their ability to redirect turbine wakes and their effects on turbine power capture and structural loads using the high-fidelity wind plant simulation tool Simulator for On/Offshore Wind Farm Applications (SOWFA).}

    abstract = "{It is well known that when wind turbines are deployed in large arrays, their efficiency decreases due to complex interactions among themselves and with the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). For wind farms whose length exceeds the height of the ABL by over an order of magnitude, a “fully developed” flow regime can be established. In this asymptotic regime, changes in the streamwise direction can be neglected and the relevant exchanges occur in the vertical direction. Such a fully developed wind-turbine array boundary layer (WTABL) has not been studied systematically before. A suite of large eddy simulations (LES), in which wind turbines are modeled using the classical “drag disk” concept, is performed for various wind-turbine arrangements, turbine loading factors, and surface roughness values. The results are used to quantify the vertical transport of momentum and kinetic energy across the boundary layer. It is shown that the vertical fluxes of kinetic energy are of the same order of magnitude as the power extracted by the forces modeling the wind turbines. In the fully developed WTABL, the kinetic energy extracted by the wind turbines is transported into the wind-turbine region by vertical fluxes associated with turbulence. The results are also used to develop improved models for effective roughness length scales experienced by the ABL. The effective roughness scale is often used to model wind-turbine arrays in simulations of atmospheric dynamics at larger (regional and global) scales. The results from the LES are compared to several existing models for effective roughness lengths. Based on the observed trends, a modified model is proposed, showing improvement in the predicted effective roughness length.}",

abstract = {An analytical model for representing body forces in numerical actuator disc models of wind turbines is developed and validated. The model is based on the assumption that the rotor disc is subject to a constant circulation modified for tip and root effects. The model comprises expressions for both the axial and the azimuthal force distributions, and is generalized to be utilized for all kinds of inflow, including wind shear, turbulence, and shadow effects in wind farms. The advantage of the model is that it does not depend on any detailed knowledge concerning the wind turbine being analysed, but only requires knowledge regarding the rated wind speed and nameplate capacity. To validate the analytical model, results are compared to numerically generated results using detailed information regarding geometry and airfoil data for the 2 MW Tjaereborg wind turbine and the 10 MW DTU reference turbine. The comparisons show very good agreement between the loadings using the new analytical model and the airfoil data based method for the two tested wind turbines, demonstrating that the analytical model is a simple and reliable way of introducing body forces in actuator disc simulations without any prior knowledge of the wind turbine being analysed.}

We apply the framework on data from 19 offshore wind farms. Our results show that the new wake model TurbOPark is overall unbiased and that the wake model error at each specific site does not depend on the mean turbine spacing. The Park model underestimates the wake loss unless a slower wake expansion than typically used is assumed. In either case, the Park model tends to underestimate the wake loss more for increasing distances between the turbines. We estimate the wake model uncertainty as less than 10% of the wake loss for the considered models.}

The first is the need for a deeper understanding of the physics of atmospheric flow in the critical zone of plant operation. The second involves science and engineering of the largest dynamic, rotating machines in the world. The third encompasses optimization and control of fleets of wind plants working synergistically within the electricity grid.

    abstract = "{Because the wake flow interaction phenomenon among wind turbines has a great influence on aerodynamic power output, wind speed deficit turbulence stress, and wake vortex structure, the wake interaction for the optimal arrangement of wind farm has recently attracted increasing attention. This paper presents a validation of aerodynamics for the two offset model wind turbines on the actuator line model and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technique. The numerical results of the present simulations are compared with those produced by testing on Blind Test 3 and other simulation models. On the basis of the simulations results, the present study shows good agreement with the experimental results. Besides, considering the uniform inflow condition, a numerical method is harnessed to simulate the complex phenomenon of wake interaction in a wind farm containing 14 wind turbines. Large eddy simulations combined with an actuator line model are conducted in the in-house CFD code FOWT-UALM-SJTU solver, which is an extension based on OpenFOAM. The motivation for this work is to create a sound methodology for performing the simulation of large wind farms. To better understand the wake interaction phenomenon, the aerodynamic power coefficients and basic features of both the near and far wake, including the distribution characteristics of the mean wake velocity and vortex structures, are studied in detail.}",

  Abstract                 = {A recently-developed large-eddy simulation framework is validated and used to investigate turbulent flow within and above wind farms under neutral conditions. Two different layouts are considered, consisting of thirty wind turbines occupying the same total area and arranged in aligned and staggered configurations, respectively. The subgrid-scale (SGS) turbulent stress is parametrized using a tuning-free Lagrangian scale-dependent dynamic SGS model. The turbine-induced forces are modelled using two types of actuator-disk models: (a) the `standard' actuator-disk model (ADM-NR), which calculates only the thrust force based on one-dimensional momentum theory and distributes it uniformly over the rotor area; and (b) the actuator-disk model with rotation (ADM-R), which uses blade-element momentum theory to calculate the lift and drag forces (that produce both thrust and rotation), and distributes them over the rotor disk based on the local blade and flow characteristics. Validation is performed by comparing simulation results with turbulence measurements collected with hot-wire anemometry inside and above an aligned model wind farm placed in a boundary-layer wind tunnel. In general, the ADM-R model yields improved predictions compared with the ADM-NR in the wakes of all the wind turbines, where including turbine-induced flow rotation and accounting for the non-uniformity of the turbine-induced forces in the ADM-R appear to be important. Another advantage of the ADM-R model is that, unlike the ADM-NR, it does not require a priori specification of the thrust coefficient (which varies within a wind farm). Finally, comparison of simulations of flow through both aligned and staggered wind farms shows important effects of farm layout on the flow structure and wind-turbine performance. For the limited-size wind farms considered in this study, the lateral interaction between cumulated wakes is stronger in the staggered case, which results in a farm wake that is more homogeneous in the spanwise direction, thus resembling more an internal boundary layer. Inside the staggered farm, the relatively longer separation between consecutive downwind turbines allows the wakes to recover more, exposing the turbines to higher local wind speeds (leading to higher turbine efficiency) and lower turbulence intensity levels (leading to lower fatigue loads), compared with the aligned farm. Above the wind farms, the area-averaged velocity profile is found to be logarithmic, with an effective wind-farm aerodynamic roughness that is larger for the staggered case.},

  Abstract                 = {ABSTRACT As wind farms become larger, the asymptotic limit of the {\^a}ÂÂfully developed{\^a}ÂÂ, or {\^a}ÂÂinfinite{\^a}ÂÂ, wind farm has been receiving an increased interest. This limit is relevant for wind farms on flat terrain whose length exceeds the height of the atmospheric boundary layer by over an order of magnitude. Recent computational studies based on large eddy simulation have identified various mean velocity equilibrium layers and have led to parameterizations of the effective roughness height that allow the prediction of the wind velocity at hub height as a function of parameters such as wind turbine spacing and loading factors. In the current paper, we employ this as a tool in making predictions of optimal wind turbine spacing as a function of these parameters, as well as in terms of the ratio of turbine costs to land surface costs. For realistic cost ratios, we find that the optimal average turbine spacing may be considerably higher than that conventionally used in current wind farm implementations.

  Abstract                 = {AbstractMean and turbulent properties of the wake generated by a single wind turbine are studied in this paper with a new large eddy simulation (LES) code, the wind turbine and turbulence simulator (WiTTS hereafter). WiTTS uses a scale{\^a}ÂÂdependent Lagrangian dynamical model of the sub{\^a}ÂÂgrid shear stress and actuator lines to simulate the effects of the rotating blades. WiTTS is first tested by simulating neutral boundary layers without and with a wind turbine and then used to study the common assumptions of self{\^a}ÂÂsimilarity and axisymmetry of the wake under neutral conditions for a variety of wind speeds and turbine properties. We find that the wind velocity deficit generally remains self similarity to a Gaussian distribution in the horizontal. In the vertical, the Gaussian self{\^a}ÂÂsimilarity is still valid in the upper part of the wake, but it breaks down in the region of the wake close to the ground. The horizontal expansion of the wake is always faster and greater than the vertical expansion under neutral stability due to wind shear and impact with the ground. Two modifications to existing equations for the mean velocity deficit and the maximum added turbulence intensity are proposed and successfully tested. The anisotropic wake expansion is taken into account in the modified model of the mean velocity deficit. Turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) budgets show that production and advection exceed dissipation and turbulent transport. The nacelle causes significant increase of every term in the TKE budget in the near wake. In conclusion, WiTTS performs satisfactorily in the rotor region of wind turbine wakes under neutral stability. Copyright {\^A}{\copyright} 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  Abstract                 = {A large-eddy simulation framework, dubbed as the Virtual Wind Simulator (VWiS), for simulating turbulent flow over wind turbines and wind farms in complex terrain is developed and validated. The wind turbines are parameterized using the actuator line model. The complex terrain is represented by the curvilinear immersed boundary method. The predictive capability of the present method is evaluated by simulating two available wind tunnel experimental cases: the flow over a stand-alone turbine and an aligned wind turbine array. Systematic grid refinement studies are carried out, for both single turbine and multi-turbine array cases, and the accuracy of the computed results is assessed through detailed comparisons with wind tunnel experiments. The model is further applied to simulate the flow over an operational utility-scale wind farm. The inflow velocities for this case are interpolated from a mesoscale simulation using a Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model with and without adding synthetic turbulence to the WRF-computed velocity fields. Improvements on power predictions are obtained when synthetic turbulence is added at the inlet. Finally the VWiS is applied to simulate a yet undeveloped wind farm at a complex terrain site where wind resource measurements have already been obtained. Good agreement with field measurements is obtained in terms of the time-averaged streamwise velocity profiles. To demonstrate the ability of the model to simulate the interactions of terrain-induced turbulence with wind turbines, eight hypothetical turbines are placed in this area. The computed extracted power underscores the significant effect of site-specific topography on turbine performance.},

abstract = { Recently the Conjugate Gradients-Squared (CG-S) method has been proposed as an attractive variant of the Bi-Conjugate Gradients (Bi-CG) method. However, it has been observed that CG-S may lead to a rather irregular convergence behaviour, so that in some cases rounding errors can even result in severe cancellation effects in the solution. In this paper, another variant of Bi-CG is proposed which does not seem to suffer from these negative effects. Numerical experiments indicate also that the new variant, named Bi-CGSTAB, is often much more efficient than CG-S. }

A comparison of the implemented actuator disk and actuator line models shows differences in the near wake which diminish in the far wake several diameters downstream of the rotor plane. Furthermore, the results of wake simulations with different inflow boundary conditions are presented. The major drawback of cyclic horizontal boundary conditions, which are often used for wake simulations, is that the inflow used will be the one already modified by the wind turbines.With non-cyclic boundary conditions and a laminar inflow, the inflow remains undisturbed and constant in time. However, a very large model domain is required so that a turbulent flow can develop. The application of a turbulence recycling method results in a well developed turbulent boundary layer already at the inflow so that the model domain can be significantly reduced.},

  Abstract                 = {ABSTRACT Accurate modelling of transient wind turbine wakes is an important component in the siting of turbines within wind farms because of wake structures that affect downwind turbine performance and loading. Many current industry tools for modelling these effects are limited to empirically derived predictions. A technique is described for coupling transient wind modelling with an aero{\^a}ÂÂelastic simulation to dynamically model both turbine operation and wake structures. The important feature of this approach is a turbine model in a flow simulation, which actively responds to transient wind events through the inclusion of controller actions such as blade pitching and regulation of generator torque. The coupled nature of the aero{\^a}ÂÂelastic/flow simulation also allows recording of load and control data, which permits the analysis of turbine interaction in multiple turbine systems. An aero{\^a}ÂÂelastic turbine simulation code and a large eddy simulation (LES) solver using an actuator disc model were adapted for this work. Coupling of the codes was implemented with the use of a software framework to transfer data between simulations in a synchronous manner. A computationally efficient simulation was developed with the ability to model turbines exhibiting standard baseline control operating in an offshore environment. Single and multiple wind turbine instances were modelled in a transient flow domain to investigate wake structures and wake interaction effects. Blade loading data were analysed to quantify the increased fluctuating loads on downwind turbines. The results demonstrate the successful implementation of the coupled simulation and quantify the effect of the dynamic{\^a}ÂÂturbine model.

  abstract      = { Similar to other renewable energy sources, wind energy is characterized by a low power density. Hence, for wind energy to make considerable contributions to the world's overall energy supply, large wind farms (on- and offshore) consisting of arrays of ever larger wind turbines are being envisioned and built. From a fluid mechanics perspective, wind farms encompass turbulent flow phenomena occurring at many spatial and temporal scales. Of particular interest to understanding mean power extraction and fluctuations in wind farms are the scales ranging from 1 to 10 m that comprise the wakes behind individual wind turbines, to motions reaching 100 m to kilometers in scale, inherently associated with the atmospheric boundary layer. In this review, we summarize current understanding of these flow phenomena (particularly mean and second-order statistics) through field studies, wind tunnel experiments, large-eddy simulations, and analytical modeling, emphasizing the most relevant features for wind farm design and operation. },

abstract = {Abstract The filtered lifting line theory is an analytical approach used to solve the equations of flow subjected to body forces with a Gaussian distribution, such as used in the actuator line model. In the original formulation, the changes in chord length along the blade were assumed to be small. This assumption can lead to errors in the induced velocities predicted by the theory compared to full solutions of the equations. In this work, we revisit the original derivation and provide a more general formulation that can account for significant changes in chord along the blade. The revised formulation can be applied to wings with significant changes in chord along the span, such as wind turbine blades.},

	abstract = {Abstract The actuator line method (ALM) is today widely used to represent wind turbine loadings in computational fluid dynamics (CFD). As opposed to resolving the whole blade geometry, the methodology does not require geometry-fitted meshes, which makes it fast to apply. In ALM, tabulated airfoil data are used to determine the local blade loadings, which subsequently are projected to the CFD grid using a Gaussian smearing function. To achieve accurate blade loadings at the tip regions of the blades, the width of the projection function needs to be narrower than the local chord lengths, requiring CFD grids that are much finer than what is actually needed in order to resolve the energy containing turbulent structures of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). On the other hand, employing large widths of the projection function may result in too large tip loadings. Therefore, the number of grid points required to resolve the blade and the width of the projection function have to be restricted to certain minimum values if unphysical corrections are to be avoided. In this paper, we investigate the cause of the overestimated tip loadings when using coarse CFD grids and, based on this, introduce a simple and physical consistent correction technique to rectify the problem. To validate the new correction, it is first applied on a planar wing where results are compared with the lifting-line technique. Next, the NREL 5-MW and Phase VI turbines are employed to test the correction on rotors. Here, the resulting blade loadings are compared with results from the blade-element momentum (BEM) method. In both cases, it is found that the new correction greatly improves the results for both normal and tangential loads and that it is possible to obtain accurate results even when using a very coarse blade resolution.},

abstract = {We present a novel mass–momentum consistent coupling between a geometric volume-of-fluid scheme and an incompressible flow solver with differing directional-splitting approaches. The advection of the volume fraction is performed using a direction-split algorithm, whereas the momentum advection algorithm uses a traditional unsplit, fractional-step approach. Both algorithms employ finite-volume discretizations based on Cartesian meshes. In solving the mass–momentum consistency problem, momentum fluxes at the cell faces are weighted by the density fluxes based on the already advected volume fraction. The success of our approach lies on introducing a Favre-averaged velocity interpolation at the liquid/gas interface along with a minmod slope limiter. Mesh-convergence studies show that when the minmod slope limiter is used, the two-phase solver retains an accuracy between first and second order, but when a purely upwind scheme is considered, its accuracy drops to first order. Finally, after considering several validation problems, the solver is shown to agree well with reference numerical and experimental data while retaining its robustness and efficiency.}

title = {Optimal smoothing length scale for actuator line models of wind turbine blades based on Gaussian body force distribution: Wind energy, actuator line model},
author = {Martínez-Tossas, L. A. and Churchfield, M. J. and Meneveau, C.},
abstractNote = {The actuator line model (ALM) is a commonly used method to represent lifting surfaces such as wind turbine blades within large-eddy simulations (LES). In the ALM, the lift and drag forces are replaced by an imposed body force that is typically smoothed over several grid points using a Gaussian kernel with some prescribed smoothing width e. To date, the choice of e has most often been based on numerical considerations related to the grid spacing used in LES. However, especially for finely resolved LES with grid spacings on the order of or smaller than the chord length of the blade, the best choice of e is not known. In this work, a theoretical approach is followed to determine the most suitable value of e, based on an analytical solution to the linearized inviscid flow response to a Gaussian force. We find that the optimal smoothing width eopt is on the order of 14%-25% of the chord length of the blade, and the center of force is located at about 13%-26% downstream of the leading edge of the blade for the cases considered. These optimal values do not depend on angle of attack and depend only weakly on the type of lifting surface. It is then shown that an even more realistic velocity field can be induced by a 2-D elliptical Gaussian lift-force kernel. Some results are also provided regarding drag force representation.},

Turbines located in updraft regions of the flow experienced lower inflow velocity and generated less power, but their wakes were observed to recover faster and saw greater turbulent kinetic energy mixing higher in the boundary layer. The opposite effect was found for turbines in the downdraft regions of the convective structures. A simplified model of this wake behavior was also developed based on a two-dimensional k– ε Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes formulation. This simplified model included the effects of vertical transport, but could be efficiently solved as a parabolic system, and was found to capture similar wake modifications observed in the high-fidelity LES computations.},

The computational methodology combines solution technologies in a multi-mesh, multi-solver paradigm through a dynamic overset framework. The coupling of a finite volume solver and a high-order, hp-adaptive finite element solver is utilized. Additional technologies including in-situ visualization and atmospheric microscale modeling are incorporated into the analysis environment. Validation of the computational framework is performed on the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) 5MW baseline wind turbine, the unsteady aerodynamics experimental NREL Phase VI turbine, and the Siemens SWT-2.3-93 wind turbine. The power and thrust results of all single turbine simulations agree well with low-fidelity model simulation results and field experiments when available. Scalability of the computational framework is demonstrated using 6, 12, 24, 48, and 96 wind turbine setups including the 48 turbine wind plant known as Lillgrund. The largest case consisting of 96 wind turbines and a total of 385 overset grids are run on 44,928 cores at a weak scaling efficiency of 86\%. Demonstration of the coupling of atmospheric microscale and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solvers is presented using the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) solver and the NREL Simulator fOr Wind Farm Applications (SOWFA) solver. }

abstract = {Abstract Numerical models of the flow and wakes due to turbines operating within a real-scale offshore wind farm can lead to a prohibitively large computational cost, particularly when considering blade-resolved simulations. With the introduction of turbine parametrizations such as the actuator disk (AD) or the actuator line (AL) models, this problem has been partially addressed, yet the computational cost associated with these simulations remains high. In this work, we present an implementation and validation of an AL model within the mesh-adaptive three-dimensional fluid dynamics solver, Fluidity, under a unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes–based turbulence modelling approach. A key feature of this implementation is the use of mesh optimization techniques, which allow for the automatic refinement or coarsening of the mesh locally according to the resolution needed by the fluid flow solver. The model is first validated against experimental data from wind tunnel tests. Finally, we demonstrate the benefits of mesh-adaptivity by considering flow past the Lillgrund offshore wind farm.},

We study the requirements in terms of resolution in the spanwise direction and establish the criteria for spacing and minimum amount of points required along the blade to obtain converged solutions.

abstract = {Abstract This article describes the application of an incompressible Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes solver to several upwind cases from the NREL/NASA Ames wind tunnel tests. In connection with the NREL blind code comparison the present results showed the overall best agreement with experimental measurements. Based on this, it is of great interest to demonstrate the quality that can be obtained in 3D CFD rotor computations. All six cases we present have 0° yaw angle and 3° tip pitch angle. All computations are performed as rotor-only computations, excluding the tower and nacelle. In this article we compare computed results and measurements in the form of shaft torque, flap and edge moments, aerodynamic coefficients and pressure distributions as a function of wind speed. The spanwise force distributions are compared with measurements for all wind speeds, along with the pressure distributions at five spanwise positions. Finally, we show how 3D CFD computations can be used to extract information about three-dimensional aerodynamic effects. Copyright © 2002 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

title = {A CFD analysis of the actuator disc flow compared with momentum theory results},
author = {Aagaard Madsen, H},
abstractNote = {The blade element momentum (BEM) model is still used in many aerodynamic and aeroelastic models for design and load calculations. This is due to its simplicity, robustness, computational speed and good accuracy for a wide range of applications. The question about accuracy is however closely connected to the airfoil section data and therefore correlation/lack of correlation with experimental results can both be due to the specific input data used and due to the induced velocity field predicted by the BEM method. It is also well-known that the BEM method for some applications is used under operational conditions that violates the assumptions made for the development of the model, e.g. operation in yaw and operation at high loading. The main objective with the present study is to investigate this part of the BEM method (the momentum strip theory MST) on which the determination of the induced velocities is based. This is done by comparing the results of the MST model with velocities predicted on basis of the Navier Stokes equations for the flow through an actuator disc. (au)},
