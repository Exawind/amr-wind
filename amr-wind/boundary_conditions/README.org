* Boundary conditions in AMR-Wind

This file describes the various boundary conditions available in =amr-wind= and
its relationship to AMReX boundary condition types available for =fillpatch= and
during linear solve. Please read the AMReX documentation at the following links
if you are unfamiliar with the boundary condition types

- BCRec :: https://amrex-codes.github.io/amrex/docs_html/Basics.html#boundary-conditions
- LinOpBCType :: https://amrex-codes.github.io/amrex/docs_html/LinearSolvers.html#boundary-conditions

=amr-wind= defines several boundary conditions that the user can specify in the input
file to handle different =BCRec= and =LinOpBCType= combinations. The user can
specify a /default/ boundary condition for the low/high faces of the
non-periodic boundaries, but can override the defaults for a specific
combination of boundary and field/variable. For example:

#+BEGIN_SRC
  xlo.type = slip_wall
  xlo.temperature_type = fixed_gradient
  xlo.temperature = 0.0
#+END_SRC

The boundary conditions that can be specified in the input file are:

- =mass_inflow= :: This is an inflow or inlet BC. The user must specify a value
  for the solution variable when using this boundary condition. The =BCRec= is
  =ext_dir= and the user-specified value is filled in the ghost cell, and
  interpreted as the value on the boundary face, during fillpatch operations.
  The =LinOpBCType= is set to Dirichlet. When specifying =mass_inflow=, the user
  *must* specify the values for the variable in the input file.

- =pressure_outflow= :: =BCRec = foextrap= and =LinOpBCType = Neumann=. This is
  the standard outflow BC for velocity and scalars. For MAC projection and
  nodal-projection, it uses a Dirichlet BC for pressure. The value of pressure
  at the boundary is specified in the input file (default = 0).

- =no_slip_wall= :: Like =mass_inflow=, this sets =BCRec= to =ext_dir= and
  specifies Dirichlet BC for the linear solvers. However, it differs from
  =mass_inflow= for velocity because the component normal to the boundary is set
  to =0.0=. The other components are read from the input file. Another
  difference from =mass_inflow= is that the default value is assumed to be zero
  if the user does not specify any inputs in the input file.

- =zero_gradient= :: Sets =BCRec= to =foextrap= and =LinOpBCType= to Neumann.
  Note, unlike the =no_slip_wall=, the normal component of velocity is also zero
  Neumann. The value on the boundary face is the same as the value at the cell
  center. No additional inputs are necessary when this BC is specified.

- =slip_wall= :: =BCRec = hoextrap= and =LinOpBCType = Neumann=. The value on
  the boundary face is /extrapolated/ from the two interior cells using a
  one-sided stencil. No additional inputs are necessary when this BC is specified.

- =symmetric_wall= ::  Sets =BCRec= to =foextrap= and =LinOpBCType= to Neumann.
  Similar to =zero_gradient= but the normal component of velocity is set to 0.

- =fixed_gradient= :: =BCRec = hoextrap= and =LinOpBCType = inhomogNeumann=.
  Like =slip_wall= the value on the face is extrapolated (during fillpatch)
  using a one-sided stencil. However, for linear solvers the value on the face
  (stored in ghost cell) is interpreted differently for =inhomogNeumann=, it is
  the gradient at the face. The value of the non-zero gradient is read from the
  input file.

- =wall_model= :: =BCRec = hoextrap= and =LinOpBCType = inhomogNeumann=. This
  boundary condition behaves like =fixed_gradient= for fillpatch, but uses an
  algorithm within the code to fill the gradient values on the faces internally
  before calling the linear solver. An appropriate algorithm must be registered
  either through the physics or turbulence model.

The following sections provide more details about the boundary conditions for
different phases of the solution process.

** Fillpatch vs. linear solver BC matrix

The following table shows the fillpatch and linear solver BC combinations
possible for scalars and tangential component of velocity.
